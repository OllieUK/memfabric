## Prioritised Backlog

> Items ordered as a dependency-safe executable sequence informed by `Priority score`.
> Higher score is better, but `Depends on` always wins for execution order.
> When a lower-score prerequisite unlocks a stronger branch, keep the prerequisite immediately ahead of that branch.
> Within an equal-score block, preserve the existing order unless a newly identified dependency requires a move.
> Add new work packages at the bottom of their equal-score block unless dependency constraints require otherwise.
> `Release` is planning metadata only. The backlog stays continuous and contiguous; release numbers indicate target package, not a separate queue.

> **Note:** old backlog items once grouped under `v2+` are now part of the same continuous backlog with `Release` assignments.
> Old v2+ WP-034 and WP-035 were renumbered WP-041 and WP-042 to avoid collision with the current WP-034/035/036 items.

## Detail Specs

### WP-047 — Near-duplicate detection for memory review

#### Motivation

As the fabric grows, semantically similar memories accumulate that should ideally be merged. Currently the only way to find them is manual inspection or coincidence during a search. A dedicated endpoint that surfaces near-duplicates enables a systematic review-and-merge loop using the WP-038 merge endpoint.

#### Design

- `GET /memory/duplicates?threshold=0.92&limit=20` — returns a list of candidate pairs `[{a: {id, text}, b: {id, text}, similarity: float}]` ordered by similarity descending.
- Implementation: iterate all Memory node pairs that have an existing `RELATED_TO` edge (already implies semantic proximity) and filter to those where cosine similarity of stored embeddings exceeds `threshold`. This avoids a full O(n²) scan by using the graph structure as a pre-filter.
- Alternatively (if no `RELATED_TO` edge yet): run the vector index search for each node and check top-k against `threshold`. Use the pre-existing `RELATED_TO` approach first; document the limitation.
- `threshold` and `limit` configurable via query param; defaults from `Settings`.
- CLI: `memory find-duplicates [--threshold 0.92] [--limit 20]`
- MCP: `memory_find_duplicates`

#### Definition of Success

- [ ] `GET /memory/duplicates` returns correct pairs above threshold, ordered by similarity
- [ ] Result excludes archived and merged memories (status filter from WP-038)
- [ ] CLI and MCP wired
- [ ] Integration test: seed two nearly-identical memories, confirm they appear as a pair; seed two unrelated memories, confirm they do not

### WP-038 — Memory lifecycle operations: update, merge, archive

#### Motivation

The fabric can add and search memories but cannot maintain them. Three lifecycle operations are essential:
- **Update** when facts change or wording improves
- **Merge** duplicates without losing provenance or graph continuity
- **Archive** memories that should no longer surface normally but remain historically recoverable

#### Data model additions

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `status` | str | `active` (default), `archived`, `merged` |
| `superseded_by` | str \| None | UUID of active replacement |
| `archived_at` | datetime \| None | Set on archive |
| `updated_at` | datetime \| None | Set on in-place update |

New edge: `MERGED_INTO` (Memory → Memory)

#### New endpoints

```
PATCH /memory/{id}          — update fact/so_what/tags/importance/person_ids/strand_ids; recomputes embedding
POST  /memory/{id}/merge    — body: {target_id, strategy}; marks source merged, rewires links
POST  /memory/{id}/archive  — sets status=archived, archived_at
POST  /memory/{id}/restore  — returns archived memory to active
```

**Search and wake-up** exclude `status in ('archived', 'merged')` by default.

#### Definition of Success

- [ ] All four endpoints implemented; `active`/`archived`/`merged` status respected in search/wake-up
- [ ] Merge rewires `ABOUT`, `IN_STRAND`, explicit `LEADS_TO`, explicit `RELATED_TO` to target
- [ ] Client + CLI + MCP updated
- [ ] Integration tests cover all status transitions

---

### WP-039 — Ephemeral test-memory handling: TTL, tagging, cleanup

#### Motivation

Integration tests write real memories to the live graph. Without explicit ephemeral semantics, test artefacts accumulate and corrupt companion context. Need: test memories excluded from normal retrieval + auto-cleaned once no longer needed.

#### Design

- `Memory.ephemeral: bool` property (default `false`); set via `POST /memory` with `"ephemeral": true`
- Ephemeral memories excluded from `POST /memory/search` and `GET /memory/wake-up` by default
- `POST /memory/maintenance/purge-ephemeral` — hard-deletes all ephemeral memories
- CLI `memory purge-ephemeral`; MCP `memory_purge_ephemeral`

#### Definition of Success

- [ ] `POST /memory` accepts `ephemeral: true`
- [ ] Search and wake-up exclude ephemeral memories by default
- [ ] `POST /memory/maintenance/purge-ephemeral` returns count deleted
- [ ] Integration tests updated to use `ephemeral: true` for test writes
